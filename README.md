# sandparticle
This is a implementation of a particle system to simulate granular materials, namely sand.

It was implemented using Unity engine, but instead of using built-in tools such as Unity's particle system and physics, all of that was implemented from scratch. Unity was used a simple framework where I built this project.

To build it all you need to do is add a new project in Unity, and then add all these files. The project comes with 4 scenes that showcase how the system works.
